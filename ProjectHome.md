This project wants to make a library available that is able to read PDF file contents. Everything is at it's infantile state, so do not expect software that is ready for production. The used language is Go/[Issue9](https://code.google.com/p/pdfreader/issues/detail?id=9), as you can see at http://golang.org

See the [Wiki-pages](http://code.google.com/p/pdfreader/wiki/Index) for more informations.
